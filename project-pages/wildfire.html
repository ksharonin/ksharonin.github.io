        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Prescribed (RX) burning is the practice of intentionally setting a controlled fire in a region. RX burns serve many purposes, most often they are used for ecological restoration, invasive plant management, agriculture, and wildfire preparation/prevention. RX burning is practiced across the world in countless cultures, and serves a critical role in maintaining a healthy forest. Burns require various expertise and effort to maintain safety and control of the fire.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Please note that my experience is heavily based on California, US practices. Different regions/countries may have different regulations and laws.</div>
          <div class="body-text">RX burning is practiced by groups of varying size, from local groups (e.g. Cal PBAs) to state (e.g. CAL FIRE) to federal level (e.g. USFS). The most accessible to regular citizens are local groups, often dubbed as "Prescribed Burning Associations" aka "PBA". In CA, I refer anyone to check out the <a href="https://calpba.org/">California PBA</a> to find local burning groups. Some communicate via email lists while others use social media.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>A Note on Certifications:</b> most if not all organizations will require you to be <b> Firefighter Type 2 (FFT2) Qualified or Certified in order to participate on burns.</b> (But, never say never; I have seen people without certifications shadow burns with the permission of the organizers/burn boss. If you are interested, please ask.)</div>
          <div class="body-text">A FFT2 is a certification issued by the NWCG that certifies you as a firefighter. The Firefighter Type 2 (FFT2) serves on a hand crew, engine crew, or helitack crew, performing fire suppression and fuels management duties in adverse climate, fuel, and terrain conditions. The FFT2 has no supervisory responsibilities and is supervised by the Firefighter Type 1 (FFT1) or a Single Resource Boss. See the official NWCG FFT2 webpage <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/positions/firefighter-type-2-crewmember/qualification-requirements">here</a>. It requires the following: </div>
          <ul>
            <li> ICS-100: Intro to ICS (free online course) </li>
            <li> L-180: Human Factors in the Wildland Fire Service (free online course)</li>
            <li> IS-700: NIMS: An Introduction (free online course) </li>
            <li> S-190: Intro to Wildland Behavior (free online course) </li>
            <li> S-130: Firefighter Training (requires an in-person component and <b>must be refreshed annually via the RT130.</b> I had to pay for my class, but if you are lucky, there can be free community offerings. Or, you can become employed by a fire agency and recieve your training for free via the organization.) </li>
            <li> Work Capacity Test (Arduous): 3 mile hike with 45 lbs in 45 minutes or less. </li>

          </ul>
          <div class="body-text">Qualified VS. Certified: FFT2 qualification and certification and nearly identical, except that certification is when you recieve an official Incident Qualification Card, otherwise nicknamed the "Red Card". <b>This card can only be issued by official fire agencies.</b> Therefore, many burners do not have the actual certification, but are still fully qualified and meet the exact same standards as an agency firefighter.</div>
