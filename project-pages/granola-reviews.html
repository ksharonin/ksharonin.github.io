The granola is very crunchy, and since you have to pick up the honey and bannanas and yogurt on the way down to reach the granola, you get the perfect flavor profile.</div>

This gets dinged a category because they don't give you fresh fruit, but there is still a lovely raspberry coulis added on top. </div>
